## Zod express middleware validation

This repo contains an example implementaion of how could we use the Zod library to
validate our request body in express, but it could work with any type of rest framework, its just a POC.

To run this application just do the following:

- Run `npm install` or `yarn`
- Edit the `inputShape` object as you like
- Send a POST request to the test URL and test your validation input
